		<h3>Unity's Launcher makes things easy.</h3>
		<h4>The Launcher gives you everything you need, right at your fingertips. It provides quick access to pinned applications and has features like keyboard shortcuts for power users.</h4>
		<p>The Launcher also replaces the standard Window List for managing running applications and open windows.</p>
		<p>While it may look like a regular dock to the untrained eye, it has a wide feature set with many that aren't immediately obvious or learnable.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Here are a few Launcher behaviours you may not know about:</p>

		<h6>Drag and drop applications from the Dash</h6>
		<p>1. Open up the Unity dash by clicking the Ubuntu logo in the left corner.</p>
		<p>2. Find the application you're looking for.</p>
		<p>3. Drag the application icon from the Dash to a position on the Launcher.</p>


		<h6>Middle mouse click to create a new window</h6>
		<p>If you've already got an application open and want to open a new window, middle mouse click on the application's icon.</p>
		<p>If you're on a laptop and don't have a middle mouse button, tap the touchpad with two fingers or press both mouse 1 and mouse 2 at the same time.</p>

		<h6 style="margin-top: 0px !important">Use keyboard shortcuts to speed up your multitasking</h6>
		<p>You can switch between applications quickly by using keyboard shortcuts.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>1. Hold down the Super key (sometimes known as the Windows key)</p>
		<p>2. The Unity launcher will appear with numbers for each application</p>
		<p>3. Press the number on your keyboard to switch to that application</p>


		<h6>Right click running applications to pin them to the launcher</h6>
		<p>If you open an application and want to keep it in the Launcher for quick in the future, simply right click on the application's icon and click Keep in Launcher.</p>


		<h6>Move your cursor to the top left corner or left edge to reveal the Launcher</h6>
		<p>When an application is fullscreen, the Launcher automatically hides to give you more screen space for focusing on the task at hand.</p>
		<p>To make the Launcher appear again, move your cursor to the left edge of the screen and hold it there for a second, or you can throw your cursor to the top left corner of the screen for the Launcher to appear instantly.</p>


		<h6>Drag things you don't need into the Trash</h6>
		<p>You can drag any files into the trash at the bottom of the launcher to delete them. </p>
		<p>To empty the trash, just right click and choose <b>Empty Trash.</b></p>

				<h6>Drag files onto launcher applications</h6>
				<p>Certain file types (such as music files, video files and text documents) can be dragged onto the launcher and then onto the relevant application.</p>
				<p>For example, if you had a music file called "song.mp3," you'd be able to drag that onto Banshee Media Player on the launcher.</p>
				<p>Banshee would then play "song.mp3".</p>
				
				<h6>Rearrange items in the Launcher</h6>
				<p>To rearrange items in Unityâ€™s Launcher, you first need to click and hold on the icon you want to move, then drag it out to the right first to free it from the Launcher.</p>
				<p>Now you can move it up or down and change its position by dropping it where you want it and letting go of the mouse button.</p>
