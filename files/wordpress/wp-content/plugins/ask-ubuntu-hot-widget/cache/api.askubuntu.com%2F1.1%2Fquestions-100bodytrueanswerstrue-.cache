But first, here are a few points to learn before entering the beta:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A. Prior to test the Firefox 4 beta<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Firefox Sync<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>If you are using Firefox Sync (previously called Weave). It is integrated in the beta. So you do not need the add-on. What does it implies to early adopter? Some glitches that the user of the final release won't notice.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mozilla needs to enhance the scalability of the Sync architecture, as this is going to be directly incorporated in the Firefox 4 release, the number of user is going to grow. So they change quite a few bit of the Sync architecture, that's why you probably saw an new update of the add-on if you're using it with the current stable release. Now this add-on is in version 1.5 (incompatible with add-on of earlier release, which means if you've updated this add-on on one of your Firefox, you have to do it on all the other).<\/p>\n\n<p>As far as I know the current beta of Firefox (beta 6) is \"compatible\" with the Sync 1.4 protocol, so Sync will not work any longer with the beta if you have updated your add-on to the 1.5 release. However, as soon as beta 7 is out (should be days now), this will work.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other side, if you're still using the 1.4 version of the Sync add-on on your stable Firefox release, then it should work with the beta 6, and as soon as you upgrade to beta 7, it will migrate your Sync data to the new architecture. So if you want to still use Firefox 3.6 on other machine, you will have to upgrade the add-on.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are definitively using Firefox 4 on a machine, you can uninstall the Firefox Sync plug-in, as it is not needed anymore.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Warnings<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This is still a beta, so things don't work always. They are still numerous slowdown, site that don't work (e.g. one.ubuntu.com is partly broken, I cannot upload file, or publish them from the web interface).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>B. A generic way<\/strong>, that work on all Linux distribution<\/p>\n\n<p>You can either go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla.com\/en-US\/firefox\/beta\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firefox Beta page<\/a> and download the latest beta. But this will download the 32bit version of Firefox, which is buggy on a 64bit system. Or you could go to <a href=\"http:\/\/releases.mozilla.org\/pub\/mozilla.org\/firefox\/releases\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firefox Repository page<\/a> where you can find the link for the latest beta (currently 4.0b6) then choose linux-x86_64 for the 64bit version, then select your language or en_US for English. And there you can download the file ending in .bz2<\/p>\n\n<p>Then you could create a directory where you're going to test this release of Firefox, unpack the downloaded package (I assume it is in your $HOME\/Downloads folder) and launch it:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>cd $HOME\nmkdir Apps\ncd Apps\ntar jxf ~\/Downloads\/firefox-4.0b*.tar.bz2\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>To launch it, it's probably more interesting to create a \"Launcher\" (Gnome specific), an icon on your desktop to launch the beta. I guess there are similar steps for KDE. For this:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Display your Desktop<\/li>\n<li>Right click and choose <code>Create launcher...<\/code> from the popup menu<\/li>\n<li>Type <code>Firefox 4 beta<\/code> for the name<\/li>\n<li>Next to <code>Command<\/code> click on the \"Browse\" button, and browser through to the Apps -> firefox and select <code>firefox<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Click on <code>OK<\/code> and double-click the Launcher :-)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong>C. An Ubuntu specific way<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You just have to add the Mozilla Daily PPA to your list of sources. There is a really good answered question about what is a PPA and how to add one, so I'm not going to repeat it here, just check the answers here: <a href=\"http:\/\/askubuntu.com\/questions\/4983\/what-are-ppas-and-how-do-i-use-them\">What are PPAs and how do I use them<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The PPA name to add (you will need it when you will follow the answers) is: <code>ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily<\/code> And Install Firefox 4 Beta as instructed in the same answered question.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning<\/strong> As some others have warned, take care that this PPA contains Firefox and a bunch of other Mozilla applications in beta.

So I will post here only the relevant information regarding Firefox 4. Please do not use multiple methods. Pick one and stick with it or revert the changes before trying a different one. I recommend the manual installation method, since depending on the PPA you choose, you will also update Firefox 3.6 and other Mozilla products.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since it is still a Beta release and there are some radical changes in this version, is recommended that you install it side-by-side with the default version and use a different <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webgapps.org\/firefox\/profiles-and-backups\" rel=\"nofollow\">user profile<\/a>, in order to avoid data loss.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Method #1 - Manual Download &amp; Installation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>First you need to download it form Mozilla [pick one only]:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla.com\/en-US\/firefox\/beta\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest \"stable\" beta release<\/a> [32bit only]<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/nightly.mozilla.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest nightly builds<\/a> [32bit and 64bit]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The easiest way to install Firefox 4 downloaded from Mozilla is to use my extension <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webgapps.org\/addons\/foxtester\" rel=\"nofollow\">FoxTester<\/a>. It allows you to instal any number of different Firefox versions, without interfering with your default installation and user profile. Everything is done through Firefox context menu, without typing commands or even closing Firefox. Although this extension is not intended for upgrading Firefox, it also allows to make any version installation permanent.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you prefer to do it manually, then follow the instructions of method #1 from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webgapps.org\/firefox\/installing-other-versions\" rel=\"nofollow\">Installing Other Versions<\/a> tutorial. Basically, you will extract the downloaded file to your \/home directory or the \/opt and execute the firefox file inside it. There are also additional steps on that tutorial if you want to make it fully compatible with plugins.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Method #2 - Ubuntuzilla repository<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This method will only be available to 32bit users, after the release of the final version of Firefox 4.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Method #3 - Installing from PPA repositories<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Firefox 4 is currently available through <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/%7Eubuntu-mozilla-daily\/+archive\/ppa\" rel=\"nofollow\">ubuntu-mozilla-daily<\/a> PPA repository (semi-official) and <a href=\"http:\/\/ubuntuforums.org\/showthread.php?t=1352580\" rel=\"nofollow\">SilverWave<\/a> PPA repository (non-official). You need to add one of those ppa repositories to your sources list, then update and install Firefox 4.<\/p>\n\n<p>To install from ubuntu-mozilla-daily on Karmic, Lucid or Maverick, run the following commands:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily\/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firefox-4.0\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>For additional info about PPA repositories see <a href=\"http:\/\/askubuntu.com\/questions\/4983\/what-are-ppas-and-how-do-i-use-them\">What are PPAs and how do I use them?<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To install from SilverWave PPA, see <a href=\"http:\/\/ubuntuforums.org\/showthread.php?t=1352580\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/ubuntuforums.org\/showthread.php?t=1352580<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><i>    The ubuntu-mozilla-daily ppa also upgrade your default Firefox installation with the latest testing version of Firefox 3.x and other Mozilla applications. So although the SilverWave PP is not official, it might be less troublesome to use it instead.<\/i><\/li>\n<li><i>When you install Firefox 4 using one of those repositories, a clone of your Firefox user profile is created under ~\/.mozilla\/firefox-4.0. So everything you do on Firefox 4 won't be saved on your default profile. This could cause confusion and apparent loss of data (bookmarks, passwords...) if you switch back and forth between Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 4 or when the last one becomes default and start using the default profile folder (i.e ~\/.mozilla\/firefox).<\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Add-on Compatibility<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>During the beta phase and to some extent after the final release of Firefox 4, most extensions and themes won't be compatible with it and thus not activated. Usually when you are testing a minor update version, you can disable compatibility check, to force extensions to be installed and activated. But is not so simple in this case, due to radical changes in the UI and the extension API of Firefox 4. So even with the compatibility check disable, several extensions won't work at all or could break other extensions and even Firefox.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are using a different profile or make regular <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webgapps.org\/firefox\/profiles-and-backups\" rel=\"nofollow\">backups<\/a>, then you could use the <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/15003\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Addon Compatibility Reporter<\/a> extension, to disable the compatibility.<\/p>\n\n<p>If something goes wrong and you can't even access the add-ons manager to disable the extensions, then <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webgapps.org\/firefox\/extension-optimization\" rel=\"nofollow\">start Firefox in safe mode and disable all extensions<\/a>. After starting Firefox in safe mode, you can enable only the compatible ones.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is strongly advised to start the \"Error Console\" (CTRL+SHIFT+J) while using Firefox with extensions that are incompatible. Disable any extension that cause an error. You might have to enable only the error report to avoid lots of css messages from web sites.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Optimization<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Although Firefox 4 is a lot faster than Firefox 3.6, is always a good idea to keep it fast by optimizing databases and tweaking some preferences.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.webgapps.org\/firefox\/database-optimization\" rel=\"nofollow\">Database Optimization<\/a>: improves startup time and performance considerably, specially on features like the awesome bar suggestions or bookmark management.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.webgapps.org\/firefox\/preferences-tweaks\" rel=\"nofollow\">Preferences Tweaks<\/a>: improves network speed, page rendering, memory usage and fixes some common issues.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/67651\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BarTab<\/a>: this nice extension allows to prevent tabs from loading the page content until they are needed. So if you usually start Firefox with several tabs, this will save memory space and improve startup time and responsiveness.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/6371\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Better Cache<\/a>: this extension allows to better control how Firefox handle the content cache, allowing to avoid constantly reloading pages and elements, thus reducing page display time considerably. Make sure you read the manual, because you might prevent sites that need to constantly reloaded from displaying new content (works with compatibility disabled).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Customization<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The very anticipated new UI hasn't been released for Linux yet. So, Firefox 4 still looks very similar to 3.6, except for a few changes, like for example the ability to place tabs on top [View &gt;&gt; Toolbars &gt;&gt; Tabs on Top]. Nevertheless, you can change a lot of things as usual, using the built-in options, themes, scripts, extensions or changing the userChrome.css.<\/p>\n"},{"answer_id":6446,"accepted":false,"answer_comments_url":"\/answers\/6446\/comments","question_id":6339,"owner":{"user_id":3581,"user_type":"registered","display_name":"pianom4n","reputation":27,"email_hash":"f7384cb64315953606376b956cdd80f1"},"creation_date":1286894611,"last_activity_date":1286894611,"up_vote_count":3,"down_vote_count":2,"view_count":1715,"score":1,"community_owned":false,"title":"How do I install Firefox 4 Beta and RC?","body":"<p>Here is what I found works best:<\/p>\n\n<p>Download it from mozilla.com and extract it (to wherever you want).

Now, let's assume that the system switches to runlevel 3, for example due to a command like \"telinit 3\" given by root. What will happen to the rc job?<\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the rc job will be started since it is currently stopped and the event runlevel 3 is matching the start events. But from now on, things are unclear to me: According to the manual $RUNLEVEL evaluates to the new runlevel when the job is started (that means 3 in our example).<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the next stanza \"stop on runlevel [!$RUNLEVEL]\" translates to \"stop on runlevel [!3]\"; that means we have a first stanza which will trigger the job, but the second stanza will never stop the job and seems to be useless.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since I know that the Ubuntu \/ Upstart people won't do useless things, I must be heavily misunderstanding something. I would be grateful for any explanation.<\/p>\n\n<p>While trying to understand this, an additional question came to my mind.

Then, the following should happen:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) The job is single instance. That means that \"start on ...\" won't be triggered since the job is currently running; $RUNLEVEL is not touched.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) \"stop on ...\" will be triggered since the <em>new<\/em> runlevel is different from $RUNLEVEL, so the job will be aborted.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Now, the job is stopped and waiting. I can't see how it is restarted with the <em>new<\/em> runlevel. AFAIK, initctl emits events only once, so \"start on ...\" won't be triggered and the new runlevel won't be entered.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know that I still misunderstanding something, and I am grateful for explanations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much!<\/p>\n"},{"tags":["10.10","firefox-beta"],"answer_count":1,"answers":[{"answer_id":30840,"accepted":true,"answer_comments_url":"\/answers\/30840\/comments","question_id":30814,"owner":{"user_id":5297,"user_type":"registered","display_name":"Reuben Swartz","reputation":337,"email_hash":"1d88ea49e14be3dea7db64fd2bc42d87"},"creation_date":1300404466,"last_activity_date":1300404466,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":44,"score":0,"community_owned":false,"title":"Firefox 4 stability?","body":"<p>If you want the most stable just wait until next Tuesday (March 22nd) for the final release.
