The keys do not have to be named like this, you can name it <code>mykey<\/code> as well and place it in a different directory as well, but in that case, you have to specify the key explicitly:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>ssh user@server -i \/path\/to\/mykey\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>If a command does not accept <code>-i<\/code>, e.g. <code>sshfs<\/code>, use the <code>IdentityFile<\/code> option:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>sshfs -o IdentityFile=\/path\/to\/mykey user@host:\/path\/on\/remote \/mountpoint\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<h2>How It Works<\/h2>\n\n<p>When generating a key, you'll get two files: <code>id_rsa<\/code> (private key) and <code>id_rsa.pub<\/code> (public key). As their names suggest, the private key should be kept secret and the public key can be published to the public.<\/p>\n\n<p>Public-key authentication works with a public and a private key. Both the client and the server have their own keys. When installing <code>openssh-server<\/code> the server public and private keys are generated automatically. For the client, you'll have to do that on your own.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you (client) connect with a server, public keys are exchanged. You'll receive the servers one, and the server yours. The first time you receives the server key, you'll be asked to accept their public key. If this public key changes over a time, you'll be warned because a possible MITM (Man in the middle) attack is going on, intercepting the traffic between the client and the server.<\/p>\n\n<p>The server checks whether you are allowed to connect (defined in <code>\/etc\/ssh\/sshd_config<\/code>) and if your public key is listed in the <code>~\/.ssh\/autorized_keys<\/code> file. Possible reasons why the public key is denied:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>\/etc\/ssh\/sshd_config<\/code>:\n<ul>\n<li><code>AllowUsers<\/code> or <code>AllowGroups<\/code> is specified, but your server user is not listed in the groups or users list (default not defined, placing no restriction on the users or groups from logging in).<\/li>\n<li><code>DenyUsers<\/code> or <code>DenyGroups<\/code> is specified and you're in the users or groups list.<\/li>\n<li>You're trying to login as root, but <code>PermitRootLogin<\/code> is set to <code>No<\/code> (default <code>yes<\/code>).<\/li>\n<li><code>PubkeyAuthentication<\/code> is set to <code>No<\/code> (default <code>yes<\/code>).<\/li>\n<li><code>AuthorizedKeysFile<\/code> is set to a different location, and the public keys are not added to that file (default <code>.ssh\/authorized_keys<\/code>, relative to home dir)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><code>~\/.ssh\/authorized_keys<\/code>: your public key is not added in this file (note that this file is read as root user)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>Using multiple keys<\/h2>\n\n<p>It's not uncommon to use multiple keys. Instead of running <code>ssh user@host -i \/path\/to\/identity_file<\/code>, you can use a configuration file, <code>~\/.ssh\/config<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Common settings are the IdentityFile (the keys) and port. The next configuration will check \"id_dsa\" and \"bender\" only:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>Host yourhost\n   Port 22\n   IdentityFile ~\/.ssh\/id_dsa\n   IdentityFile ~\/.ssh\/bender\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>If you omit <code>Host yourhost<\/code>, the settings will apply to all SSH connections. <code>Port 22<\/code> can be omitted if the server listens on port 22, but is added for clarity.<\/p>\n"}],"accepted_answer_id":30792,"favorite_count":0,"question_timeline_url":"\/questions\/30788\/timeline","question_comments_url":"\/questions\/30788\/comments","question_answers_url":"\/questions\/30788\/answers","question_id":30788,"owner":{"user_id":333,"user_type":"registered","display_name":"dustyprogrammer","reputation":2738,"email_hash":"fab591eb34c76cbd0716024ce22d4906"},"creation_date":1300376260,"last_activity_date":1300392506,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":93,"score":5,"community_owned":false,"title":"Does ssh key need to be named id_rsa?","body":"<p>I have come across this problem a couple of times when creating build servers with keyed authentication. <\/p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if anyone else has experience this.

To illustrate the problem, here is the definition (empty lines and comments are left out):<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>start on runlevel [0123456]\nstop on runlevel [!$RUNLEVEL]\nexport RUNLEVEL\nexport PREVLEVEL\nconsole output\nenv INIT_VERBOSE\ntask\nexec \/etc\/init.d\/rc $RUNLEVEL\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Let's suppose we currently are in runlevel 2 and the rc job is stopped (that is exactly the situation after booting my box and logging in via SSH). Now, let's assume that the system switches to runlevel 3, for example due to a command like \"telinit 3\" given by root. What will happen to the rc job?<\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the rc job will be started since it is currently stopped and the event runlevel 3 is matching the start events. But from now on, things are unclear to me: According to the manual $RUNLEVEL evaluates to the new runlevel when the job is started (that means 3 in our example).<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the next stanza \"stop on runlevel [!$RUNLEVEL]\" translates to \"stop on runlevel [!3]\"; that means we have a first stanza which will trigger the job, but the second stanza will never stop the job and seems to be useless.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since I know that the Ubuntu \/ Upstart people won't do useless things, I must be heavily misunderstanding something. I would be grateful for any explanation.<\/p>\n\n<p>While trying to understand this, an additional question came to my mind. If I had contradicting start and stop triggers, for example<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>start on foo\nstop on foo\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>what would happen? I swear I never will do that, but I am nevertheless very interested in how Upstart handles that on the theoretical level.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much!<\/p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Editing the question as a reaction on geekosaur's first answer:<\/p>\n\n<p>I can see the parallelism, but it is not that easy (at least, not to me).<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's assume the job aurrently is still running, and a new runlevel event comes in (of course, the new runlevel is different from the current one). Then, the following should happen:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) The job is single instance. That means that \"start on ...\" won't be triggered since the job is currently running; $RUNLEVEL is not touched.<\/p>\n\n<p>2) \"stop on ...\" will be triggered since the <em>new<\/em> runlevel is different from $RUNLEVEL, so the job will be aborted.<\/p>\n\n<p>3) Now, the job is stopped and waiting. I can't see how it is restarted with the <em>new<\/em> runlevel. AFAIK, initctl emits events only once, so \"start on ...\" won't be triggered and the new runlevel won't be entered.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know that I still misunderstanding something, and I am grateful for explanations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much!<\/p>\n"},{"tags":["unity","appearance"],"answer_count":2,"answers":[{"answer_id":30610,"accepted":false,"answer_comments_url":"\/answers\/30610\/comments","question_id":30609,"owner":{"user_id":5149,"user_type":"registered","display_name":"Alaukik","reputation":2062,"email_hash":"0e9ce7064ba5c8d2813b490ba752c859"},"creation_date":1300279883,"last_edit_date":1300280271,"last_activity_date":1300280271,"up_vote_count":9,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":110,"score":9,"community_owned":false,"title":"Will Unity allow users to change the color\/appearance of the top-Panel?","body":"<p>Yes, The color changes as per the gtk theme.<\/p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sXKes.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n"},{"answer_id":30612,"accepted":false,"answer_comments_url":"\/answers\/30612\/comments","question_id":30609,"owner":{"user_id":7286,"user_type":"registered","display_name":"NCLI","reputation":36,"email_hash":"3a92bba1e6cd4cb44efde7378c50a623"},"creation_date":1300281198,"last_activity_date":1300281198,"up_vote_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":110,"score":2,"community_owned":false,"title":"Will Unity allow users to change the color\/appearance of the top-Panel?","body":"<p>To add to the above, you can set the level of transparency yourself as well.<\/p>\n"}],"favorite_count":1,"question_timeline_url":"\/questions\/30609\/timeline","question_comments_url":"\/questions\/30609\/comments","question_answers_url":"\/questions\/30609\/answers","question_id":30609,"owner":{"user_id":12483,"user_type":"unregistered","display_name":"Sam","reputation":28,"email_hash":"f075209a7de7d0ce0c16714449987286"},"creation_date":1300279644,"last_edit_date":1300289213,"last_activity_date":1300289213,"up_vote_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":110,"score":5,"community_owned":false,"title":"Will Unity allow users to change the color\/appearance of the top-Panel?","body":"<p>I'm very excited by the functional design principles and keyboard shortcuts that are being implemented for Unity.

The other side of that is I'd like to have the script run when the user <strong>is<\/strong> superuser, and not generate the error.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any ideas on coding (if statements, etc.) on how to execute the aforementioned?<\/p>\n"},{"tags":["10.10","keyboard","shortcut-keys"],"answer_count":1,"answers":[{"answer_id":30723,"accepted":false,"answer_comments_url":"\/answers\/30723\/comments","question_id":30701,"owner":{"user_id":2725,"user_type":"registered","display_name":"Chakra","reputation":565,"email_hash":"f38ec8da440caad75ac2f34fd78c4ea3"},"creation_date":1300340078,"last_activity_date":1300340078,"up_vote_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":0,"community_owned":false,"title":"keyboard shortcuts not work\u0131ng","body":"<p>Go to System->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts and see if the entries for 'Take a screenshot' and 'Take a screenshot of a window' are present.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also try<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>sudo apt-get remove --purge shutter<\/p>\n  <\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>to remove any leftover configuration.<\/p>\n"}],"favorite_count":0,"question_timeline_url":"\/questions\/30701\/timeline","question_comments_url":"\/questions\/30701\/comments","question_answers_url":"\/questions\/30701\/answers","question_id":30701,"owner":{"user_id":9545,"user_type":"registered","display_name":"sterz","reputation":70,"email_hash":"fc83e9e78c7a0040b50bc445730ecacc"},"creation_date":1300315542,"last_edit_date":1300321767,"last_activity_date":1300340078,"up_vote_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":31,"score":1,"community_owned":false,"title":"keyboard shortcuts not work\u0131ng","body":"<p>I installed Shutter then removed it, but now <kbd>Print<\/kbd> and <kbd>Alt<\/kbd>+<kbd>Print<\/kbd> shortcuts are not working despite they seem to be assigned.<\/p>\n"},{"tags":["apt","packages"],"answer_count":4,"answers":[{"answer_id":30581,"accepted":true,"answer_comments_url":"\/answers\/30581\/comments","question_id":30482,"owner":{"user_id":721,"user_type":"registered","display_name":"Kees Cook","reputation":5213,"email_hash":"d029d69991b92af21c94ef1038a0c5c2"},"creation_date":1300260588,"last_activity_date":1300260588,"up_vote_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"view_count":96,"score":4,"community_owned":false,"title":"Is there an apt command to download a deb file from the repositories to the current directory?","body":"<p>The \"aptitude\" program provides this feature.

In fact, they're so unprocessed that the files are not even JPEG files.  Thus RAWs are typically converted to JPEG.  For this, you would typically use a RAW Editor.  A RAW editor usually does things like handle tint, exposure, things like that, which can be best tweaked before it converts to JPEG.  This is the basic task of a RAW editor, such as UFRaw or Rawstudio.  They give you control over the way the data from your camera's sensor becomes that JPEG file.<\/p>\n\n<p>An external photo editor on the other hand would be a program typically for editing regular JPEG files, and usually offers a lot more things you can do to the photograph, such as airbrushing etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>So why are some types of things expected to be done to RAW files while others are reserved for JPEG?  Well, I don't have a good reason, except that's the way it's always been done.
