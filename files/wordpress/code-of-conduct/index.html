			<p>OMG! Ubuntu! has a team of moderators who we trust to use their own good judgement to keep the comments section family friendly. Here are some guidelines to follow. If we find a user consistently breaking any of these, they will be banned.</p>

			<p>Unless your comment contains swear words it will be posted instantly. There is no queuing of comments containing links. All comments pass through a long list of swear words and are queued for approval if they contain one.</p>

			<h3>Commenting Guidelines</h3>
			<section class="entry">
				<p>We trust our moderators to make the correct decision.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="entry">
				<p>Debate/banter is fine. Personal insults, flippant attacks and derogatory comments are not acceptable. Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or ageist comments will also not be tolerated.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="entry">
				<p>Please keep potentially offensive religious remarks out of comments. We appreciate that there are many words in everyday use that only upset fundamentalists. These we consider acceptable in the right context.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="entry">
				<p>Keep expletives to a minimum. We have a filter that picks up swear words and adds them to our queue. In most instances, the moderator will simply remove your swear word and the comment will eventually be posted. It's easier for us and faster for you to simply not swear in the first instance.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="entry">
				<p>Any comments deemed inappropriate will be deleted or edited at our discretion, and we also reserve the right to delete replies to deleted comments, entire threads, or close the comment section for entire articles at any time.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="entry">
				<p>Try to keep comments on-topic to either the post in question or to the thread in which you're replying to.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="entry">
				<p>If you see a comment that you think breaks our code of conduct, click the <b>flag</b> button. This instantly notifies us. OMG! Ubuntu! is a place for all users of all abilities: try to help one-another, not get one up.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="entry">
				<p>These rules are non-negotiable and may be amended at any time. The commenting code of conduct can always be found at <a href="http://omgubuntu.co.uk/code-of-conduct">omgubuntu.co.uk/code-of-conduct.</a> Feel free to refer to this if you see anyone breaking the guidelines.</p>
